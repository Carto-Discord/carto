# Carto - Mapping Discord Bot

Carto aims to give DMs and Players on Discord a simple way to track movement around a gridded map.

[![Deployment](https://github.com/Carto-Discord/carto/actions/workflows/deployment.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Carto-Discord/carto/actions/workflows/deployment.yml)

## Getting Started

Documentation, including instructions on how to add Carto to your server can be found at https://carto-discord.github.io/carto

## Development

This project uses [NPM Workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces), and thus requires a Node version of 14 or higher, and an NPM version higher than 7.

Each package is individually documented, but all builds, tests and linting can be run from the root directory with

```
npm run build
npm run test
npm run lint
```

respectively.
